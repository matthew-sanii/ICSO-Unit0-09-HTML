    <th>For the past month the Canadian government has told us to practice social distancing to limit the spread of Covid 19 by staying at home. The whole goal is to flatten the curve so we can get out of this pandemic faster. According to LifeScience.com, in epidemiology, the idea of slowing a virus' spread so that fewer people need to seek treatment at any given time is known as "flattening the curve." So staying home is the smartest decision to make. Some people will not show symptoms but can still spread the virus. Staying at home and practicing social distancing lowers the likelihood of an infected person spreading Covid-19, and keeps everyone else safe. This will keep people out of the hospitals, which are filling with confirmed cases. The doctors and nurses are working overtime trying to help those who are infected. So please, do your part. Stay at home. I know it sounds simple but also understand that these are stressful times. The fear triggered by the Covid outbreak is causing some bizarre behaviors. You don’t need 50 rolls of toilet paper. The entire family doesn’t need to go shopping. Remember, everyone is going through this. The stress and fear are leading to even more problems. Just this past week, a security guard was hit by an angry driver, all because he couldn’t bring his partner into the store with him. Please be nice, people. Show each other kindness and patience. If you don’t stay at home, the pandemic will go on much longer than anyone wants and there will be more deaths. We do not want a high number of cases like in Italy. So PLEASE STAY AT HOME!</th>
